## Experiments in visualisation - Simple interactive charts with crossfilter.js and dc.js ## 

I have always liked doing things the hard way. And so I have eschewed the higher level visualisation libraries that allow one to create charts in a few lines.

D3.js has hence been the tool of my choice for online visualisation for a while now (and will be the subjects of many other posts). But decided to experiment with the crossfilter.js and dc.js libraries recently.

The code in this repository provides a simple overview of how to setup up an interactive chart with crossfilter.js and dc.js, and is documented [here](https://medium.com/@mythoughtsarewandering/experiments-in-visualisation-simple-interactive-charts-with-crossfilter-js-and-dc-js-5195f5eeeb15)
